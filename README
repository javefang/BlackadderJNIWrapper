TODO (MemoryOptimisation):
- Optimise the publishDirect methods, reduce numbre of direct ByteBuffer allocation by reusing them (becuase allocatDirect() is slow)
- Have a ByteBufferPool managed by native code
	- ByteBufferPool.getByteBuffer();   // get available ByteBuffer from 
- Change the async sending code in JNI, return submitted ByteBuffer back to ByteBufferPool
- possible memory leak in BAWrapperShared native code (consider to do string/hex conversion in Java to reduce JNI call overhead)
